      <description>Welcome to the Great Lakes Permaculture Network! My name is Aaron Martz. I now live outside of Clarkston, Michigan. I began my permaculture journey in 2014, and I have been lucky to be able to learn from various people in various parts of the world. It has been very hard to find these people though, and that is the inspiration for this site.
This site is here to provide a regional repository of events, people, organizations and common resources for permaculture praticioners, farmers, natural builders, etc.</description>
