# Welcome to the Great Lakes Permaculture Network!

My name is Aaron Martz. I now live outside of Clarkston, Michigan. I began my permaculture journey in 2014, and I have been lucky to be able to learn from various people in various parts of the world. It has been very hard to find these people though, and that is the inspiration for this site.

This site is here to provide a regional repository of events, people, organizations and common resources for permaculture praticioners, farmers, natural builders, etc. in the Great Lakes Regions (which for this site encompasses Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin). The location here matters - it is easy to find national and international permaculture organizations and resources, but to find information specific to our regional climates and geographies is much more difficult. So let's place it all here! These states, while varying in many areas, have similar growig zones and weather patterns, and so many resources will apply to all 5 of these states.

If you would like to contribute anything (or even join as an informal partner to help maintain and grow this site) please reach out by <a href="/contact"><b> contacting me</a></b>. Or send a message if you want to say hi and connect. I'm interested in finding people to post on the blog with site updates, event reports, etc. I also would like to place events on our <a href="/events"><b>events page</a></b> and <a href="/organizations+practicioners"><b>organizations and practicioners</a></b> so that others can find out about them!

Thanks for checking the site out, and please keep watch and this site grows.

Aaron
