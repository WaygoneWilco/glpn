## Permaculture Basics

* [Gaia's Garden - Toby Hemenway](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136542.Gaia_s_Garden) - The number one recommended beginner's permaculture guide, teaching the basics through home-scale gardening.
* [Earth User's Guide to Permaculture - Rosemary Marrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/381992.Earth_User_s_Guide_to_Permaculture) - Another great permaculture gardening introduction from a permaculture elder.

## Permaculture Design

* [Permaculture Design: A Step by Step Guide - Aranya](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13665169-permaculture-design) - An uncomplicated booklet that guides you through the design process. Short and to the point.
* [Permaculture: A Designer's Manual - Bill Mollison](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/381988.Permaculture) - regarded as many practicioners as the permaculture "Bible" this is a classic permaculture text. Often chaotic in presentation of information, it is also out of print and expensive. Not the best introductory text.

## Food Forest Design
* [Edible Forest Gardens: 2 Volume Set](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/831196.Edible_Forest_Gardens) - Dave Jacke and Eric Toensmeier take a heavy analytic and scientific based design approach to creating food forests (what they call edible forests). Well worth it for temperate designers.
* [How to Make a Forest Garden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1292427.How_to_Make_a_Forest_Garden) - One of the earliest food forest books, but it is dated and has many holes in information. Useful for understanding the basics though, but serious designers will want Wedible Forest Gardens.

## Natural Building
This is an area with a huge amount of information, and choosing the right technique is essential to having a comfortable, long-lasting home in our region. **Strawbale or light-straw clay** are two of the best choices.

* [Serious Straw Bale: A Home Construction Guide for All Climates - Paul Lacinski,  Michael Bergeron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/664515.Serious_Straw_Bale) - A bit dated now, but contains many essential concepts for straw-bale construction, from two big names in the trade.
* [More Straw Bale Building - Chris Magwood, Peter Mack and Tina Therrien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/861166.More_Straw_Bale_Building) - Called by Owen Geiger as one of the best books on straw-bale contruction (a pretty good recommendation then).
* [Essential Light Straw Clay Construction - Lydia Doleman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31944790-essential-light-straw-clay-construction) - Not a ton of books specifically related to light-straw clay, but here is one by an experienced builder.
* [The Last Straw Journal](https://thelaststraw.org/) - An on-again off-again journal of all things natural building. Lots of great content in every issue (not currently being updated though).
